                <p>Washington State is home to some of the most breathtaking mountain landscapes in the country, drawing visitors from all over the world. From the snow-covered peaks of Mount Rainier and Mount Baker to the vast evergreen forests and crystal-clear alpine lakes, the state offers a perfect mix of adventure and serenity. During winter, these natural wonders transform into a playground for snowboarders, skiers, and outdoor enthusiasts alike. People travel far and wide to experience Washington’s fresh powder, scenic views, and the peaceful feeling of being surrounded by pure wilderness. The mountains here aren’t just a destination—they’re a reminder of how beautiful and powerful nature can be.</p>

                <h2 class="para-head">Respect the slope</h2>
                <p>When visiting snowboarding resorts, it’s important to keep the mountain clean by properly disposing of trash and respecting nature. Always take your waste with you or use designated bins to prevent litter from harming wildlife and the environment. Small actions, like picking up a snack wrapper or avoiding plastic bottles, help keep the slopes beautiful and enjoyable for everyone. A clean mountain means a better experience for all riders and future generations.</p>

                <h2 class="para-head">Mountain tips</h2>
                <p>One of the easiest ways to keep the mountain clean is to **pack out everything you bring in**. This includes snack wrappers, water bottles, and any disposable items. Carry a small bag in your backpack to collect trash throughout the day, so you’re never leaving waste behind on the slopes.<br></p>

                <p><p>Another important habit is to **use recycling and trash bins whenever possible**. Many resorts provide clearly marked containers at lodges, parking lots, and trailheads. Taking a few extra seconds to sort your waste helps reduce landfill contributions and protects the surrounding ecosystem.<br></p>
