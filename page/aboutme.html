                        <p>As a fourth-season snowboarder, I’ve come to appreciate the beauty and freedom that Washington’s mountains offer each winter. From early morning runs through fresh powder to late afternoons spent watching the sun dip behind the peaks, snowboarding has become more than just a hobby—it’s a part of who I am. But over the past few seasons, I’ve started to notice something that’s been taking away from the experience: an increase in trash scattered around the resorts.<br>

                    What once felt like untouched nature is slowly being overshadowed by litter—bottles, wrappers, and discarded gear left behind. Most of it seems to come from tourists and casual mountain-goers who may not realize the impact of leaving trash behind. It’s disappointing to see such beautiful places treated carelessly, especially when so many of us come here to connect with nature and escape the noise of everyday life.<br>

                    Keeping the mountains clean isn’t just about appearance; it’s about respect—for the environment, for other riders, and for the local communities that care for these resorts year-round. I believe every snowboarder and skier can make a difference by packing out what they bring in and encouraging others to do the same. After all, the mountains give us so much joy—it’s only right we protect them in return.<br></p>
